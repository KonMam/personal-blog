**My name is Konstantinas**, and I like exploring new ideas and writing about them. With a technical background, I often dive into systems, tools, and ways to make things work better, though I don’t limit myself only to that.

Outside of the technical world, I enjoy single player games such as *Skyrim*, *The Witcher*, *Elden Ring*, and *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33*. I also read a lot of fantasy and science fiction, with favorites including Brandon Sanderson’s *Cosmere* stories, James S. A. Corey’s *The Expanse*, Liu Cixin’s *The Three Body Problem*, and Andy Weir’s *Project Hail Mary*.

This blog is where I collect what I’m working on and what interests me. Sometimes that’s technical, sometimes not.
