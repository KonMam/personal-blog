I'm a data engineer by day. This blog is where I write things down so I don't forget them -- and in case they're useful to someone else.

Data engineering never sits still -- there's always a new tool, a new tradeoff, a new reason the old approach doesn't quite work anymore. I write about that, and whatever else catches my attention. If you like digging into how things actually work, you'll probably find something here.

Outside of work I read a lot -- fiction, mostly speculative (Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere and James S. A. Corey's *The Expanse* have eaten a significant portion of my life), but plenty of other things too. I also play games when I can: open-world RPGs, ARPGs, or roguelikes.
