<!--
TOPICS TO COVER:
- What orchestration actually solves (scheduling, dependencies, observability)
- Airflow: still dominant by market share, 3.0 caught up on features but still playing catch-up
- Dagster: asset-centric model, best for engineering-culture teams, strong local dev
- Prefect: cloud-native, fast iteration
- Kestra: fastest-growing new entrant, worth watching
- 20% of teams have no orchestration at all — is that fine at small scale?
- What to pick for different team sizes and setups
- Same survey format as the warehouse post
