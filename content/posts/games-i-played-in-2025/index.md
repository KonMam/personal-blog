A look back at every game I played in 2025 — what I liked, what I didn't, and whether they're worth your time.

2025 was a good year for games. According to my Steam Replay, I played 30 games across the year. Here are my top 3, followed by a rundown of the rest.

## Top 3

{{< game-entry title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33" cover="expedition33.jpg" >}}

Uncontested Game of the Year. The soundtrack alone earned the top spot — it was my number one album on Spotify Wrapped, and I'm looking forward to receiving the vinyl collection and attending the live concert. The gameplay felt like a modern take on classics like Final Fantasy, which is one of my favourite series (at least VII, VIII, IX, X). The voice acting was phenomenal — Ben Starr, Jennifer English, and the rest of the cast all delivered, and the fact that they got Andy Serkis is wild. The story was genuinely mind-bending. I'll 100% be coming back to this game more than once in the future.

{{< game-entry title="Hades II" cover="hades2.jpg" >}}

As a huge fan of Greek mythology, both Hades games hold a dear place in my heart. The modern take on the classics is a joy, and I love how well the story and gameplay complement each other. Hades II made some significant changes to the formula and is a much larger game overall. I think I like them equally — both have their own charm. Scylla's soundtrack is an absolute highlight. Loved this game, and it's a close contender for my game of the year.

{{< game-entry title="Blue Prince" cover="blue-prince.jpg" >}}

A roguelike puzzle game — what?! I even took out a notebook and wrote down everything I thought might be a clue like a maniac. Unfortunately something got in the way and I put it down for a hot minute, which turned into never picking it back up. Still one of my top games of the year even with the limited playtime. Definitely one I want to get back to.

## The Rest

{{< game-entry title="Path of Exile 2" cover="poe2.jpg" >}}

The initial honeymoon period was a blast — exploring a new take on Path of Exile felt fresh, and the gameplay loop had me hooked early on. There were some performance issues at launch, but those got ironed out over time. As the hours piled up though, it became clear the game still needed to cook a bit more. Compared to PoE1, the build and gameplay variety just isn't there yet, but as an early access title that's to be expected. Solid foundation — I'll be back.

{{< game-entry title="Path of Exile" cover="poe.jpg" >}}

Came back to PoE1 after spending time with PoE2. It's a game I've sunk way too many hours into and still feel like I've only scratched the surface. There's something comforting about it — the kind of game where you turn your brain off, put on a podcast, and farm for that next build you want to try. For now it's the one I prefer out of the two, but we'll see what the future brings.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance" cover="kingdom-come.jpg" >}}

It took a while for me to finally get around to this one, but it was a nice ride. Going from peasant Henry barely able to lift a sword to ripping apart anyone who crosses your path was a satisfying journey. There were a bit too many fetch quests for my liking, but riding on horseback through Bohemia made up for it. The early game had plenty of frustrating moments — getting massacred anytime you face more than one enemy while still learning the combat system. Looking forward to getting a chance to play the sequel.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Borderlands 3" cover="borderlands3.jpg" >}}

This one was a nice surprise. The first time I tried it, performance issues and the cringe-worthy story drove me away. But with Borderlands 4 on the horizon, I was motivated to give it another shot — and I'm glad I did. Played through the game on multiple characters, and with the performance issues fixed and the story safely ignored, the gunplay and abilities more than made up for the drawbacks. Farming for builds kept me entertained for a good while.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Last Epoch" cover="last-epoch.jpg" >}}

Can't even remember what class I played, but the endgame loop kept me around — being able to target-farm exactly what you need is something PoE could learn from. A good time while it lasted, just not sticky enough to leave a lasting impression.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Gunfire Reborn" cover="gunfire-reborn.jpg" >}}

Played through it with the tiger character — lightning abilities, big guns, not much thinking required. Can't even remember the specific builds, which probably says everything about how much it stuck with me. Good for filling a gap between games, nothing more.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Baldur's Gate 3" cover="bg3.jpg" >}}

My Sisyphean stone. 2025 was my second attempt at getting through it, and I've already started and likely abandoned another run this year. It's just so difficult to finish such a massive game in one go when you're exploring everything, and coming back to the same run after a break never quite works. It's a game I absolutely enjoy — there's just something about getting to Act 2 and parking it. Maybe run four will be different.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered" cover="oblivion.jpg" >}}

Pure nostalgia. I played the original back around 2010–2013 and thoroughly enjoyed it. This Elder Scrolls has some of the best side quests in the series — Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Whodunit — they completely blow Skyrim's out of the water. Unfortunately, performance at launch wasn't great and the difficulty scaling was off — everything was either way too easy or impossibly strong — so I had to put it down before getting through the greatest hits. I want to come back now that most of the issues have been addressed. And the fact that Bethesda shadow-dropped it — damn you Todd Howard, taking my money again.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Persona 3 Reload" cover="persona3.jpg" >}}

Played Persona 3 Portable back in the day on PSP, so this was a bit of a nostalgia trip — though the PSP version was reduced in scope, so there was plenty of new ground to cover. Didn't end up finishing it; got somewhat bored along the way. Out of the modern trilogy, I'd rank 4 first, 5 second, and 3 last — the characters and story just don't grab me as much as the other two.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Hades" cover="hades.jpg" >}}

Came back to Hades for the nth time — this was before Hades II came out, and I haven't been back since. It's always fun to jump in for a few runs and try to push a higher heat. This game has some of my favourite music in all of gaming, Good Riddance being the standout.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="ARC Raiders" cover="arc-raiders.jpg" >}}

I rarely play online games outside of ARPGs, so this was a jump into a different genre. It was a fun communal experience — scavenging through the wasteland, making friends with randoms until extraction. Or not so fun when they shoot you in the face right before you extract. Got burned out fairly quickly though, as it demands more energy than the kind of games I typically gravitate towards.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Elden Ring" cover="elden-ring.jpg" >}}

One of my all-time favourites. In 2025 I finally beat the DLC and it was a blast. Also did a co-op run for the first time — made the game a lot easier, but still fun. Even now I'm thinking it would be great to do another full playthrough, so this is something I'll jump back into from time to time, until the next FromSoft game drops and steals the thunder.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Monster Hunter World" cover="mhw.jpg" >}}

Came back and tried the Switch Axe after maining Longsword on previous runs. The endgame decoration farming is where Monster Hunter really shines for me, but getting through the main story to reach it again is a slog. Didn't make it there this time.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Cyberpunk 2077" cover="cyberpunk.jpg" >}}

Already played through Cyberpunk before and thought the new patches might make it feel fresh again. They didn't — I'd gotten what I wanted from it the first time around, and nothing pulled me back in for more.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl" cover="stalker.jpg" >}}

Watched a few streams of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 and thought it looked interesting, so I decided to give the original a go for the first time. Apparently I suck, since I got the worst ending. But overall the game was fun if a bit clunky, and not outrageously long, so I managed to beat it. There are still two more games in the original series, so I might get to them at some point for the full experience before jumping into S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Lies of P" cover="lies-of-p.jpg" >}}

Great game. Combat felt a bit clunky coming off Elden Ring, but the weapon assembly mechanic was a fresh take. Romeo, King of Puppets tested whether I'd actually git gud — died to him more than I'd like to admit, but learning that fight was the highlight. Parked it before the end and never came back, but it's one I'd like to finish.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="DOOM" cover="doom.jpg" >}}

DOOM 2016. Mick Gordon absolutely cooked on the soundtrack — shame about all the drama that happened during Eternal's development. Had this game in my library possibly since 2016 and never got very far, even though I always liked the idea of it. Finally got myself to actually play it and what do you know, it's a banger. Eternal is on the list.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Vampire Survivors" cover="vampire-survivors.jpg" >}}

A bit late to the party with this one. Turned my brain off and that's exactly what I got — mindless fun for a few evenings. Does what it says on the tin.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Disco Elysium: The Final Cut" cover="disco-elysium.jpg" >}}

Managed to die within the first few minutes by failing the skill check to turn on the lights. That moment sold me on the game instantly — I wasn't expecting to be killed by a light switch. The drunkard detective and his inner voices are brilliantly written. Maybe one day I'll experience the full thing, but that day was not in 2025.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" cover="witcher3.jpg" >}}

Installed it for a few hours in January 2025. I've played it so much in the past and enjoyed it so deeply that it holds a very nostalgic place in my mind. But it's hard for the game to beat the nostalgia at this point. Looking forward to The Witcher 4, but I think I'm done with this one. Sometimes you gotta let things go.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Hollow Knight" cover="hollow-knight.jpg" >}}

I want to like it and I feel like I do, but the gameplay just doesn't capture me enough. It's a game I'll keep coming back to and dropping indefinitely. The circle of life.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Borderlands 4" cover="borderlands4.jpg" >}}

Would love to tell you about it, but I had to request a refund. An unoptimised mess that runs terribly unless you have a NASA PC. I might play it in a few years when Borderlands 5 is coming out and it'll probably be great by then. Time will tell.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Tekken 8" cover="tekken8.jpg" >}}

Childhood nostalgia — Tekken 2 and 3 were some of the first games I ever played on PS1. With 8 coming out it felt like a good time to get back into the series. Had some fun battles with friends and randoms, but the ranked/sweaty competitive side is probably not for me. It stresses me out, and that's not what I'm looking for during my relaxation time.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth" cover="isaac.jpg" >}}

Wish I was good enough to get to the fun part, but the controls just don't click for me. It has everything I like in a game — roguelite, build variety, weird lore — but it doesn't come together when I'm the one holding the controller.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="NieR: Automata" cover="nier.jpg" >}}

Only got through the intro mission. Probably didn't help that I'd already watched a full playthrough — hard to motivate yourself to push through a game when you already know every twist.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Risk of Rain 2" cover="ror2.jpg" >}}

Engineer main — there's something deeply satisfying about stacking items and watching your turrets inherit everything, turning them into absolute death machines. Love the soundtrack too. Came back ahead of the new DLC but burned out before it dropped. Still, I keep coming back every few months for a few runs.

{{< /game-entry >}}

{{< game-entry title="Stardew Valley" cover="stardew.jpg" >}}

I come back to it when I need something completely stress-free, and then I realise I need to maximise shareholder value. The chill farming game quickly becomes a stressful optimisation exercise — making sure I'm planting the optimal crops and doing everything in the most efficient way possible.
