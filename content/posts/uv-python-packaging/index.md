<!--
TOPICS TO COVER:
- What was broken: pip, virtualenv, pyenv, poetry — why people kept switching
- What uv does differently: single tool, written in Rust, dramatically faster
- Hands-on: set up a project from scratch, show the workflow end to end
- uv as pip replacement, venv manager, and python version manager
- Lockfiles and reproducibility
- Aimed at developers who've felt the pip/poetry pain but haven't switched yet
